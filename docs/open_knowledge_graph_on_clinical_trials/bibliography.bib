    abstract = {The new Semantic Web recommendations for RDF, RDFS and OWL have, at their heart, the RDF graph. Jena2, a second-generation RDF toolkit, is similarly centered on the RDF graph. RDFS and OWL reasoning are seen as graph-to-graph transforms, producing graphs of virtual triples. Rich APIs are provided. The Model API includes support for other aspects of the RDF recommendations, such as containers and reification. The Ontology API includes support for RDFS and OWL, including advanced OWL Full support. Jena includes the de facto reference RDF/XML parser, and provides RDF/XML output using the full range of the rich RDF/XML grammar. N3 I/O is supported. RDF graphs can be stored in-memory or in databases. Jena's query language, RDQL, and the Web API are both offered for the next round of standardization.},

  abstract = {The Resource Description Format (RDF) is used to represent information modeled as a "graph": a set of individual objects, along with a set of connections among those objects. In that role, RDF is one of the pillars of the so-called Semantic Web. This paper describes how RDF-XML is used to serialize information represented using graphs, how RDF graphs can be read and written by using the Jena software package, and how distributed graphs can be queried using the SparQL query language. It includes examples showing how SparQL can be used to query data (such as the Gene Ontology) that is structured in hierarchies, and how SparQL queries can be submitted through SparQL endpoints. It does not, however, delve into inference or the Web Ontology Language (OWL), but should provide a foundation for understanding those topics.},

    abstract = {Background The ClinicalTrials.gov registry provides information regarding characteristics of past, current, and planned clinical studies to patients, clinicians, and researchers; in addition, registry data are available for bulk download. However, issues related to data structure, nomenclature, and changes in data collection over time present challenges to the aggregate analysis and interpretation of these data in general and to the analysis of trials according to clinical specialty in particular. Improving usability of these data could enhance the utility of ClinicalTrials.gov as a research resource.   Methods/Principal Results The purpose of our project was twofold. First, we sought to extend the usability of ClinicalTrials.gov for research purposes by developing a database for aggregate analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) that contains data from the 96,346 clinical trials registered as of September 27, 2010. Second, we developed and validated a methodology for annotating studies by clinical specialty, using a custom taxonomy employing Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms applied by an NLM algorithm, as well as MeSH terms and other disease condition terms provided by study sponsors. Clinical specialists reviewed and annotated MeSH and non-MeSH disease condition terms, and an algorithm was created to classify studies into clinical specialties based on both MeSH and non-MeSH annotations. False positives and false negatives were evaluated by comparing algorithmic classification with manual classification for three specialties.   Conclusions/Significance The resulting AACT database features study design attributes parsed into discrete fields, integrated metadata, and an integrated MeSH thesaurus, and is available for download as Oracle extracts (.dmp file and text format). This publicly-accessible dataset will facilitate analysis of studies and permit detailed characterization and analysis of the U.S. clinical trials enterprise as a whole. In addition, the methodology we present for creating specialty datasets may facilitate other efforts to analyze studies by specialty groups.},
