    abstract = {The new Semantic Web recommendations for RDF, RDFS and OWL have, at their heart, the RDF graph. Jena2, a second-generation RDF toolkit, is similarly centered on the RDF graph. RDFS and OWL reasoning are seen as graph-to-graph transforms, producing graphs of virtual triples. Rich APIs are provided. The Model API includes support for other aspects of the RDF recommendations, such as containers and reification. The Ontology API includes support for RDFS and OWL, including advanced OWL Full support. Jena includes the de facto reference RDF/XML parser, and provides RDF/XML output using the full range of the rich RDF/XML grammar. N3 I/O is supported. RDF graphs can be stored in-memory or in databases. Jena's query language, RDQL, and the Web API are both offered for the next round of standardization.},

  abstract = {The Resource Description Format (RDF) is used to represent information modeled as a "graph": a set of individual objects, along with a set of connections among those objects. In that role, RDF is one of the pillars of the so-called Semantic Web. This paper describes how RDF-XML is used to serialize information represented using graphs, how RDF graphs can be read and written by using the Jena software package, and how distributed graphs can be queried using the SparQL query language. It includes examples showing how SparQL can be used to query data (such as the Gene Ontology) that is structured in hierarchies, and how SparQL queries can be submitted through SparQL endpoints. It does not, however, delve into inference or the Web Ontology Language (OWL), but should provide a foundation for understanding those topics.},
